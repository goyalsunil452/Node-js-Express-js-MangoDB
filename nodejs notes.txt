Node JS === === === ==


is runtime environment which uses the V8 engine ,where you can run javascript on physical machine.
can use as server side component.

where express js is developer framework
and mongoDB as database.

fullStack development.
MEAN  ==> MangoDB + Express js + Angular + Node js
MERN  ==> MangoDB + Express js + React + Node js

Node Architecture behind the scenes

    javascript ---->  google V8 engine ------> machine code ---->   Node can understand this

to create server side framework node js require libuv library


in java web server (tomcat server) has multiple Threads (200)

but in node js there is only one Thread then how do node js handle multiple request
Ans ==>  node js uses two concept 
           1). Non-blocking I/O  ==>  it wont block request from miltiple client and send request to another server to and thread free.
                                      that's why node js is not preferable for CPU intesive work ,mostly is preferable for I/O intesive work
          
           2). Asynchronous   ===>    to provide response to client in case of multiple client req , node js use callback method (Asynchronous)


             and node js uses the libuv library which is built in c-lang which uses system kernel and which has multiple threads.
             so basically node js uses multiple thread 


node package manager:
      npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.



node js process is c++ code which running on machine running
node js run on single thread

if libuv has heavy task (file system api, cryptography, compression, DNS lookup, etc) it uses Thread pool other wise it uses Event Loop.


Event Loop ===>>  All aplication code that is inside callback function(non-top-level code);
                  node js is build around callback function.
                  Event-driven architecture.
                  Event loop does orchestration

      check event-loop.js for event and thread concept.

      Streams ==>  used to process(read and write) data piece by piece without completing the whole read or write
                   operation and therefore without keeping all the data in memory
                   example : netflix and youtube

Callback hell ==> also known as Pyramid of Doom, is an anti-pattern seen in code of asynchronous programming. 
                  It is a slang term used to describe and unwieldy number of nested “if” statements or functions.
                  If you are not expecting your application logic to get too complex, a few callbacks seem harmless.

            it can be resolved by using promises

promises ==>  Promises in javascript are a way to handle asynchronous operations in Node. js.

 EXPRESS JS ✔😁

Express ==> is minimal node.js framework, higher level of abstraction.
            is a back end web application framework for Node.js 

            It contains a very robust set if features like complex routing, 
            easier handling of requests and response, middleware, server-side rendering.

            it allow for rapid development of node.js application.

            express make it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.
